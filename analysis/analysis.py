# Figure 2: Gap between posts
#    For a user who churns, gap between consecutive posts keeps increasing.
#    Gaps for those who stay are much lower, and stabilize around 20,000 minutes,
#      indicating routine posting activity in every â‰ˆ2 weeks.

# Figure 3: # Answers vs Churn probability
#    The probability of churning for a user decreases the more answers s/he provides.
#    It is even lower if s/he asks more questions alongside.

# Figure 4: K vs Time taken for the first answer to arrive
#    The more the time taken for a user to receive an answer,
#      the lesser the satisfaction level and the more the chances of churning.
